Louisiana Tech University - Computer Science Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

- Linked List Sorting Program – Implemented a Python program that takes a value as a user input, creates a singly linked list of nodes containing random values in a range from 0 to 100, and sorts the list using a selection sort algorithm.
- Sudoku Program – Implemented a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles by functions that apply reduction rules on a puzzle until it is solved.
- AVL Tree Program – Implemented a Python program to create and manipulate a AVL tree abstract data structure.
- Kruskal’s Algorithm Program – Implemented a Python program that prints an adjacency list of a graph and creates a minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph using Kruskal’s algorithm.
- Heapsort Program – Implemented a Python program that applies a heapsort algorithm on a provided list.
- Spell Checker Program – Implemented a Python program to use the trie data structure and use it for spell-checking an input file.
